# GeoNode Cloud

**GeoNode Cloud** is an advanced cloud-based implementation of the [GeoNode](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode) platform, optimized for leveraging native or cloud-adapted technologies. This solution is designed to be deployed on Kubernetes, enabling scalability, efficient management, and resilience.

GeoNode Cloud includes the [GeoServer Cloud](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver-cloud) project, which provides strong support for the publication, editing, and management of geospatial data. This integration reinforces GeoNode Cloud’s role as a modern, efficient infrastructure for managing geospatial information in the cloud.

By using GeoNode Cloud, organizations can benefit from increased flexibility, reduced operational costs, and seamless integration with other cloud-native tools and services.
